# Yene Learn Platform

A comprehensive learning platform that helps users discover, organize, and learn from educational videos.

## Features

- Track learning progress across different courses
- AI-powered learning assistant to help with your learning journey

## API Key Setup

To use the AI features of Yene Learn, you need to configure a Google Gemini API key. There are two ways to do this:

### Method 1: Using environment variables (Recommended for developers)

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
2. Add your Gemini API key:
   ```
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Restart the development server

### Method 2: Using the UI (For all users)

1. When you see the "API Connection Error" screen, you'll find a form to enter your API key
2. Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
3. Enter your API key in the form and click "Save API Key"

## Getting a Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key or use an existing one
3. Make sure the API key has access to the Gemini model
4. There are no usage charges for the basic tier of API usage

## Security Note

When using Method 2 (UI input), your API key is stored securely in your browser's local storage and is never transmitted to our servers. It stays on your device only.

## Setting Up the Gemini API

The AI chat functionality requires a Gemini API key to work properly. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Get a Gemini API Key**:
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create or sign in to your Google account
   - Create a new API key

2. **Configure the API Key**:
   - Create a `.env` or `.env.local` file in the project root
   - Add the following line with your actual API key:
     ```
     VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
     ```
   - Restart the development server if it's already running

3. **Verify the Connection**:
   - Open the application
   - Navigate to the Learning Chat section
   - Try sending a message to verify the connection

## Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Troubleshooting API Issues

If you experience issues with the AI chat:

1. Check that your API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
2. Ensure your API key has not expired or reached its quota limit
3. Verify your internet connection
4. Check the browser console for specific error messages
